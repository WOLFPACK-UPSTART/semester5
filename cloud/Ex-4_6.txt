Procedure from Exercise 4: 
Scale and Load Balance Your Architecture

Set Up the Environment:

Prepare a cloud environment with necessary resources, such as instances and databases.
Define the requirements for scaling and load balancing.
Configure Auto Scaling:

Use Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to automatically add or remove instances based on demand.
Set scaling policies, triggers, and alarms (e.g., CPU utilization or traffic thresholds).
Set Up a Load Balancer:

Deploy a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer or similar in your chosen cloud provider).
Configure routing rules and associate the load balancer with your instances.
Test the Configuration:

Simulate traffic to ensure the system scales correctly.
Verify that the load balancer distributes traffic evenly across instances.
Monitor and Optimize:

Use monitoring tools to analyze performance.
Adjust configurations for better efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Procedure from Exercise 6: 
Create a VPC
This document provides a detailed procedure for creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and associated resources. Here's the summarized procedure:

Access the Amazon VPC Console:

Go to Amazon VPC Console.
Navigate to the VPC dashboard and choose Create VPC.
Configure VPC Settings:

Name Tags: Use auto-generated or custom name tags for resources.
IPv4 CIDR Block: Enter a valid IPv4 address range.
(Optional) IPv6 CIDR Block: Enable support for IPv6 traffic.
Set Tenancy:

Choose between Default (shared hardware) or Dedicated (dedicated hardware) tenancy.
Specify Availability Zones and Subnets:

Choose at least two Availability Zones (AZs) for a production environment.
Configure the number of public and private subnets and their CIDR blocks.
Add Additional Resources:

NAT Gateways: Deploy for private subnets needing internet access.
Egress-only Internet Gateway: Enable for IPv6 traffic if required.
VPC Endpoints: Configure if direct access to Amazon S3 or other services is needed.
Tagging and DNS Options:

Add tags for resource identification.
Enable or disable domain name resolution as per requirements.
Review and Create:

Visualize the resource relationships in the Preview pane.
Choose Create VPC to finalize.
Post-Creation Tasks:

View the created VPC resources.
Optionally, terminate the VPC if no longer needed.
